                    <h2>Philippines: Overcoming the Cycle of Poverty<br>From: Maryknoll Office for Global Concerns.</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px; padding-left: 75px; padding-right: 75px;">The following commentary by Irish missionary priest Shay Cullen, SSC, was published by the Union of Catholic Asian News (UCAN) on February 14, 2020. A member of the Missionary Society of St. Columban, Father Cullen has worked to promote human rights and the rights of children, especially victims of sex abuse, in the Philippines for nearly 50 years. The following article was published in the March-April 2020 issue of NewsNotes.

                      There is extreme poverty in the world. One percent of rich people have more money and wealth than the combined wealth of 4.6 billion people who have almost nothing. Worldwide there are about 735 million people in extreme poverty.
                      
                      In the Philippines, there are an estimated six million people in extreme poverty. Why is there so much inequality in the world?
                      
                      Can the power of goodness bring social justice and overcome the devastating harm done by powerful, greedy, and selfish people? They must be challenged, opposed and resisted by those dedicated and committed to doing well.
                      
                      Humanity develops when there is sharing, cooperation, justice, freedom and equality among people. When these values pervade daily life, they bring peace, harmony and well-being. People have to change peacefully the political and economic forces that allow them such a life.
                      
                      Each of us can help our neighbors and find ways to open the cage of poverty and let them fly free. Everyone needs a job and a just wage to support their family. The following is a true story, one that is repeated many times over.
                      
                      Luisito was a boy from a hungry, homeless family. They lived in poverty under sacks at the edge of a beach. His father was a simple fisherman but when international fishing companies were given commercial fishing permits in Philippine waters by corrupt officials, the fish disappeared.
                      
                      Thousands of Filipinos were thrown into the pit of poverty. Luisito, then 15, collected junk, plastic bottles, anything he could sell for a few handfuls of rice. That's all they had but it wasn't enough. Sickness took his father.
                      
                      One day Luisito, who was emaciated with hunger, was seen by the owner of a basket-weaving shop and invited to learn basket weaving. He was a person of conscience and he judged it the right thing to do and did it.
                      
                      Luisito was amazed when he was paid, in advance, a generous trainee's allowance. Immediately he bought rice and fish for the family, the first that they had in weeks.
                      
                      He was determined to succeed and joined several workers in the small factory. Quickly he became a skilled worker and was paid a higher just wage and given shelter in the workshop. The cage was open.
                      
                      Luisito saw a way to overcome poverty. He went to evening classes and graduated high school and, with the help of the basket shop owner, he eventually graduated from college and found a managerial job. He saved his family and his own children. They became college graduates and they have good jobs today.
                      
                      That was and is the exception rather than the common reality.
                      
                      That was 30 years ago. The Philippine population is now 110 million and, while poverty has lessened, there are 23.1 million Filipinos going hungry every day, down from 28.8 million in 2016, according to a World Bank survey.
                      
                      That is still 23 million too many. Yet many more millions of Filipinos, while not grievously hungry, are still living in poverty.
                      
                      The world has moved on to new economic challenges, so new skills and education are needed to help make a just economy where the youth of today will find good pay in high-tech jobs with dignity and equality.
                      
                      The nation needs to produce more high-value products in a sustainable way that protects the environment and heals the damaged planet.
                      
                      To help bring this about, Pope Francis will launch a new initiative called the "Economy of Francesco" at a world meeting of economists and business people with a conscience. It is to be held in Assisi, Italy, in March.
                      
                      Global action is urgently needed. Millions of people around the world demand change and refuse to be submissive and docile or live in fear of the rich. They now protest inequality, low wages, poverty, unemployment, environmental destruction. They raise their voices at rallies, marches and demonstrations or quietly advocate and create public awareness of social injustice.
                      
                      Equality will have to come by the action of just governments that will tax the rich and compel them by law to pay higher wages. Governments must also provide social development, health, housing, and employment with just wages, as government is supposed to be at the service of the people, for the people, by the people to overcome poverty.
                      
                      In the Philippines it is the rich who control Congress; they rule by family dynasty and will very seldom legislate against their own interests, and only under intense public pressure.
                      
                      What is to be done to overcome poverty? One thing is to defeat and remove corrupt officials. Politicians promise to do this in order to get elected and have power, but most are corrupt themselves.
                      
                      As the Philippine Daily Inquirer reported in January 2020: "The Philippines slipped 14 notches from its previous ranking in the latest Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), a rating of global anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International has shown."
                      
                      In the group's CPI 2019, the Philippines scored 34 to land in 113th spot, down from 99th place in 2018.
                      
                      Despite that vexing and painful truth, there has been change for the good. There are millions of children and youth getting a better education nowadays thanks to many Filipino people of compassion, with social conscience, who don't tolerate injustice and poverty and lobby and pressure government officials to act justly. It is a slow and frustrating incremental progress.  
                      
                      The restless youth and workers can't wait and are demanding jobs and higher wages and benefits, a life free from hunger and want.
                      
                      The rich oppose this. They grow rich from low wages, restrictive labor laws, short-term contract workers, exploitation, plundering natural resources and paying low or no taxes. The labor movement is frozen.
                      
                      Educated workers are frustrated and migrate with their brainpower, skills, and knowledge. The Philippines can lower the rate of poverty if the government will invest in advanced technology training and encourage business to create higher-value employment and make high-value products. This will give more spending power to people. That in turn spurs greater economic growth.
                      
                      Breaking the cycle of poverty will only happen when many more millions develop a conscience, have compassion, and give equal opportunities to the poor by sharing their wealth. Together we can help the poor to rise out of poverty and open the door of the cage so that they can fly free.</p>

                  <h2>Philippines Pandemic Of Poverty<br>From: Asia News Network.</h2>
                  <p style="font-size: 20px; padding-left: 75px; padding-right: 75px;">MANILA - This paper's editorial (“Poor yet to feel fruits of GDP”) last Monday gave us a clear picture of something wrong that's happening in our country's economic trajectory. When viewed from the top, our economy is on a “high growth path.” But when assessed on the ground, the “high growth” describes instead our very alarming level of poverty.

                    The National Economic and Development Authority trumpeted that our economy grew by 6.4 percent in the first three months of this year, beating many countries in the Asian region. This reportedly extends the uninterrupted period of growth of our economy that began in the second quarter of 2021.
                    
                    The growth is even more impressive, multiple times over, for our country's business giants. The Ayala, SM, San Miguel, Megaworld, and Metrobank business conglomerates have earned net incomes that grew from 30 to 38 percent for the same quarter of this year.
                    
                    In very glaring contrast to these rosy pictures, a Social Weather Stations survey revealed that some 51 percent of Filipino families rated themselves poor during the same first quarter of 2023. That's more than half of all Filipino families who admit to being impoverished. And that]s a total of 14 million families, an increase from the 12.9 families who already felt poor in December 2022.
                    
                    If the Marcos administration continues with the same old policies that have failed to stop the spread of destitution, our country]s already serious social dysfunction will worsen even more. The attributes of our economy, politics, culture, and social order will be defined by the afflictions of poverty.
                    
                    Many of our people experience poverty in two ways. Rural producers sell their harvest at very low prices that confine them to subsistence living. Urban end-consumers buy their food supplies at prices that vastly diminish their purchasing power.
                    
                    Because I spend equal time living both in the province and city nowadays, I notice the huge difference in rural and urban prices of food commodities. Tomatoes, for instance, are currently selling at P10 per kilo in our small town, while they're sold from P50 to P100 per kilo in Metro Manila. Of course, transportation, storage, handling, and spoilage are inevitable factors that increase city prices, but there’s still a sizeable profit margin for traders or middlemen.
                    
                    Our local government unit (LGU) in Alcala, Cagayan, has embarked on a program of buying palay from small farmers at prices higher than those offered by traders. Our LGU then mills the palay at its newly set up milling station. It then sells rice to our town's end-consumers at prices lower than market prices. Our LGU performs both functions—not in the form of subsidy because it actually recovers its costs — as a pro bono trader/middlemen, which it has assumed as an expanded public service for its constituents.
                    
                    Our LGU has also been directly buying white corn from its farmers which it then processes and sells as its one town one product offering. Our LGU has further organized its peanut and white corn farmers and has linked them up with food manufacturers who now directly buy the farmer's harvest, erasing the role of middlemen. Farmers’ cooperatives are being assisted and our LGU is likewise linking them up directly with food processors.
                    
                    Poverty is spreading among real people, while prosperity is expanding among fictional persons (i.e., corporations). This is the surreal and perverse reality that besets our country.
                    
                    In the face of this crisis, our economic managers must not depend on the old and discredited practice of relying on prosperous businesses to cause a trickle-down of benefits to the masses. Our government cannot leave the role of increasing wages (through increased demand for jobs) and decreasing prices, to business conglomerates whose reason for being is the exact opposite—to minimize wages and to increase prices. Our government must include in its arsenal of solutions, minimizing the role of traders, and actively facilitating direct connections between farmers and consumers, as well as farmers and food manufacturers.
                    
                    Now is a time for our national and local governments to utilize their enormous powers and vast resources to expand the breadth and scope of “public service” in order to confront head on our pandemic of poverty.

                  <h2>Philippines Pandemic Of Poverty<br>From: Asia News Network.</h2>
                  <p style="font-size: 20px; padding-left: 75px; padding-right: 75px;">A recent survey by the Social Weather Stations (SWS) showed that over half of Filipino families considered themselves poor.

                    Conducted March 26-29, the poll showed that 51% of Filipino families considered themselves poor, 30% rated themselves as “borderline” (placing themselves on a line between poor and not poor), and 19% categorized themselves not poor.
                    
                    The SWS noted the results of the March poll are similar to the results of its December 2022 survey that found 51% of Filipino families self-rated as poor, 31% said they were borderline, and 19% considered themselves not poor.
                    
                    “The estimated numbers of Self-Rated Poor families are 14 million in March 2023 and 12.9 million in December 2022. To arrive at the estimated numbers of Self-Rated Poor families, the percentage of respondent households rating themselves as poor was applied to the Philippine Statistics Authority medium-population projections for 2023 and 2022, respectively,” the pollster explained.
                    
                    Comparing the December 2022 and the March 2023 data, the SWS noted the latest number of self-rated poor families was due to the increases in the National Capital Region, which rose from 32% to 40%, and in Visayas, which jumped from 58% to 65%. It was combined with a decline in Balance Luzon, which fell from 49% to 43%, as well as a statistically steady trend in Mindanao, climbing from 59% to 62%.
                    
                    For the data on borderline, the SWS said it “did not statistically change” in Metro Manila from 29% to 26%, in Balance Luzon from 30% to 32%, and in Mindanao from 30% to 33%. In the Visayas, meanwhile, it fell from 34% to 26%.
                    
                    More families rated themselves not poor in Balance Luzon, which increased from 20% to 25%. It was the opposite in Metro Manila, which declined from 39% to 33% and in Mindanao from 11% to 6%. Data in Visayas remained at 9%.
                    
                    The SWS also reported that in the last five quarters, the national median Self-Rated Poverty Threshold (SRP Threshold) stayed at ₱15,000, while the national median Self-Rated Poverty Gap (SRP Gap) rose from ₱5,000 in December 2022 to ₱6,000 in March 2023.
                    
                    “The SRP Threshold, or the minimum monthly budget self-rated poor families say they need for home expenses in order not to consider themselves poor, has remained sluggish for several years despite considerable inflation. This indicates that poor families have been lowering their living standards, i.e., belt-tightening,” it explained.
                    
                    “In the past, the median SRP Gap has generally been half of the median SRP Threshold. This means that average poor families lack about half of what they need to not consider themselves poor. An increase in the proportion of the median SRP Gap relative to the median SRP Threshold means a worsening in families’ budget for home expenses,” it added.
                    
                    Per area, the median SRP Threshold in NCR increased from ₱15,000 in December 2022 to ₱20,000 in March 2023 while the median SRP Gap rose from ₱6,000 to ₱10,000.
                    
                    For Balance Luzon, the median SRP Threshold remained at ₱15,000 while the median SRP Gap rose from ₱5,000 to P6,000.
                    
                    In Visayas, the median SRP Threshold also stayed at ₱15,000 as well as the median SRP Gap that stayed at ₱7,000.
                    
                    Mindanao also retained its levels, with the median SRP Threshold remaining at ₱10,000 while the median SRP Gap staying at ₱5,000
                    
                    The March 2023 survey was conducted through face-to-face interviews of 1,200 adults nationwide. The sampling error margins are ±2.8% for national percentages, ±5.7% each for Metro Manila, Balance Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.
