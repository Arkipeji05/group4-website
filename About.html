       Poverty estimates—the number and percentage of persons living 
       in poverty—have been of interest to Congress not only to gauge 
       the nation's economic health,but also because they are used to 
       determine funding allocations for a variety of programs. Understanding 
       how poverty is defined, how it is measured, and what information is used 
       to compute poverty estimates can help congressional policymakers more adeptly
       consider how proposed legislation might affect the low-income population. To that end, 
       this report provides a synopsis of poverty measurement in the United States, focusing on the following:
    </b></p>
      <b>
      • the official measure of poverty, which is used to obtain official counts and percentages of the poor;
      <br>
      • the Supplemental Poverty Measure, which is used for research purposes only and was developed to improve upon some limitations of the official measure; and
      <br>
      • the Health and Human Services (HHS) poverty guidelines, which are used in administering programs for low-income persons but not to measure the poor population.
      <br>
      • the official measure of poverty, which is used to obtain official counts and percentages of the poor;

   Poverty is about not having enough money to meet basic needs including food, 
   clothing and shelter. However, poverty is more, much more than just not having 
   enough money. In addition to a lack of money, poverty is about not being able to 
   participate in recreational activities not being able to send children on a day 
   trip with their schoolmates or to a birthday party not being able to pay for 
   medications for an illness. These are all costs of being poor. Those people who 
   are barely able to pay food and shelter simply can't consider these other expenses.
   When people are excluded within a society, when they are not well educated and 
   they have a higher incidence of illness, there are negative consequences for society.
   We all pay price for poverty. The increased cost on the health system, the justice 
   system and other systems that provide supports to those living in poverty has an impact on our economy.

    <h5><b> The main causes of poverty in the country include the following:</b></h5>
    <br>
     <b>
    • low to moderate economic growth for the past 40 years;
    <br>
    • low growth elasticity of poverty reduction;
    <br>
    • weakness in employment generation and the quality of jobs generated;
    <br>
    • failure to fully develop the agriculture sector;
    <br>
    • high inflation during crisis periods;
    <br>
    • high levels of population growth;
    <br>
    • high and persistent levels of inequality (incomes and assets), which dampen the positive impacts of economic expansion; and
    <br>
    • recurrent shocks and exposure to risks such as economic crisis, conflicts, natural disasters,and "environmental poverty."

    <center><h1><b>Solution to Poverty</b></h1></center>
    <hr class="border border-light border-3 opacity-50">
  <br>

  <h4>1. INCREASE ACCESS TO EDUCATION</h4>
  <br>
  <p><b>
    • According to UNESCO, if all students in low-income countries had just basic reading skills 
    (nothing else), an estimated 171 million people could escape extreme poverty. If all adults
    completed secondary education, we could cut the global poverty rate by more than half. Education 
    develops skills and abilities, corrects some of the imbalances that come out of marginalization,
    and decreases both risk and vulnerability.
  </b></p>

  <br>

  <h4>2. IMPROVE FOOD SECURITY AND ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER</h4>
  <br>
  <p><b>
    • Simply eating three meals a day and getting a healthy amount of calories and nutrients can go a long
    way to addressing the cycle of poverty. When a person doesn’t have enough to eat, they lack the 
    strength and energy needed to work. Contaminated water can lead to debilitating illnesses.
  </b></p>  

  <br>
  
  <h4>3. CREATE GOOD-PAYING JOBS THAT MEET FAMILY NEEDS</h4>
  <br>
  <p><b>
    • Rebuilding the economy in an equitable way requires the creation of millions of new, good-paying jobs
    in key industries, with significant worker protections to ease the burden on working families.
  </b></p>    

  <br>
  
  <h4>4. END WAR AND CONFLICT</h4>
  <br>
  <p><b>
    • No war means that budgets allocated to cover the cost of conflict can be used to deliver public services.
    It also reduces risks faced by the most vulnerable communities, and ensures that goals towards equality 
    and inclusion can be maintained.
  </b></p>    

  <br>
  
  <h4>5. COMMIT TO CLIMATE CHANGE SOLUTIONS AND CLIMATE JUSTICE</h4>
  <br>
  <p><b>
    • Resilience against climate change is especially important and deserves its own mention. According to the 
    World Bank, climate change could force an additional 100 million people into extreme poverty over the next 
    decade without any urgent action taken.

    <h1><b>Poverty Measures Are Not the Same as Sufficiency Measures</b></h1>
    <hr class="border border-dark border-3 opacity-50">
  <p><b>
    Even within their focus on financial resources, the purpose of these poverty measures when they were developed 
    was to accurately measure economic privation rather than to describe the full complement of resources a person 
    or family needs to be self-sufficient. Mollie Orshansky, the researcher whose work formed the basis of the official 
    poverty measure, characterized the distinction this way: "if it is not possible to state unequivocally 'how much is 
    enough,' it should be possible to assert with confidence how much, on an average, is too little.

      <h2><b>Cyclical poverty</b></h2>
      <hr class="border border-3 opacity-100">
      <p>
      Cyclical poverty refers to poverty that may be widespread throughout a population, but the occurrence itself is of 
      limited duration. In nonindustrial societies (present and past), this sort of inability to provide for one’s basic 
      needs rests mainly upon temporary food shortages caused by natural phenomena or poor agricultural planning. Prices 
      would rise because of scarcities of food, which brought widespread, albeit temporary, misery.

      <br>
      <h3><b>Collective poverty</b></h3>
      <hr class="border border-3 opacity-100">
      <p>In contrast to cyclical poverty, which is temporary, widespread or “collective” poverty involves a relatively permanent
         insufficiency of means to secure basic needs—a condition that may be so general as to describe the average level of life
         in a society or that may be concentrated in relatively large groups in an otherwise prosperous society. Both generalized
         and concentrated collective poverty may be transmitted from generation to generation, parents passing their poverty on 
         to their children.

      <br>
      <h3><b>Concentrated collective poverty</b></h3>
      <hr class="border border-3 opacity-100">
      <p>In many industrialized, relatively affluent countries, particular demographic groups are vulnerable to long-term poverty.
         In city ghettos, in regions bypassed or abandoned by industry, and in areas where agriculture or industry is inefficient 
         and cannot compete profitably, there are found victims of concentrated collective poverty.
      </p>

    <div class="p-3 lead my-3 content-center" 
    style= "color: white ; text-align: center; background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87)">
      <br>
      <h3><b>Case poverty</b></h3>
      <hr class="border border-3 opacity-100">
      <p>Similar to collective poverty in relative permanence but different from it in terms of distribution, 
        case poverty refers to the inability of an individual or family to secure basic needs even in social 
        surroundings of general prosperity. This inability is generally related to the lack of some basic attribute 
        that would permit the individual to maintain himself or herself. Such persons may, for example, be blind, 
        physically or emotionally disabled, or chronically ill. Physical and mental handicaps are usually regarded 
        sympathetically, as being beyond the control of the people who suffer from them. Efforts to ameliorate poverty 
        due to physical causes focus on education, sheltered employment, and, if needed, economic maintenance.</p>
